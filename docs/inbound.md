:::caution

A user must be registered as a contact on your account before their messages will be routed to you. This can be done by sending them a message or adding them as a contact.

### Receiving Messages

In order to enable receiving messages, you have to specify the webhooks that you want to use in your api dashboard.

Received Messages will be sent as a POST request to the webhook which you define. These messages will be delivered in the JSON of a POST body which looks like this:

```json
{
  "accountEmail": "support@sendblue.com",
  "content": "Ahoy Developer!",
  "media_url": "some_cdn_link.png",
  "is_outbound": false,
  "status": "RECEIVED",
  "error_code": null,
  "error_message": null,
  "message_handle": "xxxxx",
  "date_sent": "2020-09-10T06:15:05.962Z",
  "date_updated": "2020-09-10T06:15:05.962Z",
  "from_number": "+19998887777",
  "number": "+19998887777",
  "to_number": "+15122164639",
  "was_downgraded": false,
  "plan": "blue"
}
```

:::important
You must send a response to our server in order to avoid receiving multiple webhook calls.
