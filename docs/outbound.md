The Sendblue API conforms to REST API standards. Using it, you can send outbound iMessage and SMS to any enabled phone globally. All requests can either be form-encoded or

In this documentation, we will cover how to:

1.  [Send iMessages to a destination phone number](/docs/outbound#sending-imessages)
2.  [Track the status of your message using webhooks](/docs/outbound#status-callback)

## Sending iMessages

You can send a message directly with cURL or by using one of our client libraries by hitting the following endpoint:

`POST https://api.sendblue.co/api/send-message`
Here's what that looks like as a curl request:

```bash
curl --location --request POST 'https://api.sendblue.co/api/send-message' \
--header 'sb-api-key-id: YOUR_SB_API_KEY_ID' \
--header 'sb-api-secret-key: YOUR_SB_API_SECRET_KEY' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "number": "+19998887777",
    "content": "Hello world!",
    "send_style": "invisible",
    "media_url": "https://picsum.photos/200/300.jpg",
    "status_callback": "https://example.com/message-status/1234abcd"
}'
```

And here's the same in Node.js with Axios

```js
const axios = require("axios");

const url = `https://api.sendblue.co/api/send-message`;

axios
  .post(
    url,
    {
      number: "+19998887777",
      from_number: "+16468528190", // the sendblue number you want to use
      content: "Hello world!",
      send_style: "invisible",
      media_url: "https://picsum.photos/200/300.jpg",
      status_callback: "https://example.com/message-status/1234abcd",
    },
    {
      headers: {
        "sb-api-key-id": "YOUR_SB_API_KEY_ID",
        "sb-api-secret-key": "YOUR_SB_API_SECRET_KEY",
        "content-type": "application/json",
      },
    }
  )
  .then((response) => {
    console.log(response.data);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error(error);
  });
```

  "content": "Hello world!",
  "is_outbound": true,
  "status": "QUEUED",
  "error_code": null,
  "error_message": null,
  "message_handle": "dfd747ba-5600-4a8a-804a-a614a0fbc1c5",
  "date_sent": "2023-09-27T16:35:32.287Z",

  "opted_out": false,
  "error_detail": null
}
```

## Sending files

You can send images using the `media_url` parameter. This URL should be a CDN link pointing to an image. The URL must end with the proper file extension. We recommend sticking to the standard PascalCase naming convention. So if your image is named "Welcome Image", we recommend uploading it to your CDN as "WelcomeImage.png".

Files are currently capped at **5MB**.

media_url does not support [signed urls](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/access-control/signed-urls#:~:text=about%20request%20signing.-,Overview,specific%20actions%20on%20a%20resource.), please use the [media object](/docs/create-media-object) pattern for that

## Status Callback

Sendblue will POST the endpoint you provide in `status_callback` whenever the status of a message changes to one of the following:

- queued
- failed
- sent
- delivered
- read

Below is an example of the POST body that is sent to the status_callback URL for a delivered message:

```json
{
  "accountEmail": "support@sendblue.com",
  "content": "Hello world!",
  "is_outbound": true,
  "status": "DELIVERED",
  "error_code": null,
  "error_message": null,
  "message_handle": "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxx",
  "date_sent": "2020-09-10T06:15:05.962Z",
  "date_updated": "2020-09-10T06:15:14.115Z",
  "from_number": "+15122164639",
  "number": "+19998887777",
  "to_number": "+19998887777",
  "was_downgraded": false,
  "plan": "blue"
}
```

You must send a response to our server in order to avoid receiving multiple webhook calls.

## Limits

Messages sent using Sendblue must be less than 18996 characters in length. If you have larger requirements we recommend breaking the message up into several, smaller messages.

## Useful Information

### From Number

:::caution

Sendblue focuses on message deliverability and end-user experience. This means that each of your users will only ever interact with your business through one Sendblue phone number. However, different clients may see different numbers for texts sent from your company. See [Limits & Queues](/docs/message-limits) for more info

:::

The from_number field is given as a convenience to you, in case you want to keep track of that info, or tell the client that they should expect a text from the number that you show them.

### Handle

The message handle is used so that you can query the status of each message at a later date. This is especially useful in high volume message_status=QUEUED cases or TIMEOUT cases.
