#### How much do dedicated numbers cost?

Dedicated numbers are priced differently depending on country, area code, functionalities, and use-case. [Contact us](mailto:support@sendblue.com) to get a quote and to learn about our bulk number discounts.

#### What will happen to my existing users if I upgrade to a different dedicated number?

Existing users will still be messaged from the old number to ensure a consistent user experience. While new users will be messaged from the new number. If you'd like to migrate all users to the new number, just let us know during the upgrade.

#### Is there a minimum messaging requirement for the Enterprise plan?

Yes, the minimum messaging requirement to be on the enterprise plan is 10,000 messages/month.

#### Can this service be shut down by Apple?

No, All of your messages get sent out regardless of underlying services. Our fallback from iMessage to SMS (via our upstream carrier) happens if we see that an iMessage has failed to send. if an SMS fails via our upstream carrier, we retry it using a scale SMS provider such as Twilio. Our 3-level retry mechanism ensures that our messages have the highest deliverability rates on the market.

Keep in mind that you need to configure a Twilio account in the dashboard to fallback to, and as of July 6th 2023 we require an A2p 10DLC application to send A2P 10DLC with our upstream provider.

#### Are there any free-forever plans?

Yes, we have a ton of free-forever plans for people building cool things. We announce them as giveaways on our [Twitter](https://twitter.com/sendbluedotco). If you'd like to apply for a free-forever plan please send an email to [nikita@sendblue.co](mailto:nikita@sendblue.co)

#### Is Sendblue a competitor to Community?

No, not directly - although we understand why people say Sendblue is a better, faster, and higher quality alternative to that service.

## Messaging

---

#### Why aren't my links expanding?

Apple blocks your phone from expanding links when a sender is not in your contact list. A handy workaround is to send an Apple contact card to your user. See our [Send a contact card](/docs/contact-card) quickstart to get this going quickly

#### What happens if the recipient of a message doesn't have an iPhone?

If the recipient of one of your messages doesn't have iMesssage enabled we will automatically fall back to sending the message through SMS at no extra cost.

#### Does a number have to be a contact prior to me sending a message to it?

No, a contact will automatically be created when a message is sent through the API. However a contact does have to be registered in order to receive inbound messages from them.

#### Can I delete contacts and add new ones to stay under the limit?

Yes, however the messages are tied to the contact will no longer appear in the conversations view of your dashboard.
